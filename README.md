# Beta-Attack

Beta-Attack is a pen testing desktop app that thorougly searches a developer's project for XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. 
Test your application throughout your development life cycle and identify weaknesses in order to provide a secure experience for your users.

# Usage
Paste a url of your project, click submit and watch your results return in seconds.

If any errors return, copy the link of the url from the results and identify your fields that are vulnerable.

If no errors return, congratulations! You're app is secure of the most common XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

# Why Beta-Attack?

We built Beta-Attack to let developers test their applications from the beginning of the development process, rather until the end.
Although there are many pen testing tools available, none give developers an easier user experience. 

We wanted Beta-Attack to be simple to use, and avoid submission of fatal payloads that can damage the integrity and accessibility of your app.
